Emergency AI System
Description:
This project is an advanced international emergency voice analysis and response system designed to assist during disasters such as earthquakes, floods, or large-scale accidents. It combines real-time speech recognition, emotion and stress analysis, vulnerability detection, and multilingual AI-guided instructions to prioritize emergency calls and provide context-aware guidance to affected individuals.

Key Features:

Multi-Language Support: 14 languages including English, Turkish, French, Persian, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Italian, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Japanese, German, and Portuguese.

Real-Time Speech Recognition: Converts spoken emergency calls into text for analysis.

Emotion & Stress Analysis: Detects stress, panic, or calmness and visualizes it with a live stress graph and stress meter.

Condition & Vulnerability Detection: Automatically identifies situations such as trapped individuals or bleeding injuries, and flags vulnerable populations (children, elderly, injured).

Urgency Scoring & Priority Ranking: AI assigns priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and provides a confidence score.

Interactive AI Instructions: Generates adaptive emergency messages based on stress level, condition, and language.

Explainable AI Layer: Displays why a call is considered critical for transparency.

Live Dashboard: Shows multiple calls in real-time with a dynamic table and heatmap simulation for critical areas.

Animated Emergency Alerts: Visual cues for critical calls to simulate a real emergency operations center.

Professional UI/UX: Polished responsive interface with gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and visual stress indicators.

Judge Demo Mode: Simulated multiple calls with heatmap, priority alerts, and interactive features for competitions.

Offline-Ready Simulation: Demonstrates functionality without internet for disaster scenarios.

Use Case:
Designed for emergency response centers, disaster management agencies, and international competitions, this system helps prioritize calls, deliver adaptive instructions, and provide a visual dashboard for rapid decision-making.

Demo:
